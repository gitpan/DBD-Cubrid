   Copyright (c) 2011  Zhang Hui, China

*** QUICK START GUIDE:

    The DBI requires one or more 'driver' modules to talk to databases.
    Fetch, build and install the DBI module as per its README file.
    You may then delete its source directory tree since it's no longer needed.
    Use the 'perldoc DBI' command to read the DBI documentation.

    Fetch this DBD::cubrid driver module and unpack it.
    Follow the guidelines in this README file carefully.


*** BUILDING:

Execute:

    perl Makefile.PL            # use a perl that's in your PATH

Use the perl that is first on your PATH. Then execute:

    make

    make test

If the all the formal tests pass then, finally, run:

    make install

End.
